History of Corrugated Cardboard Pizza Boxes

Pizza boxes are an integral part of many pizza joints' offerings. They help customers stay warm and help the environment. They also save money, which is reinvested in employee wages and community projects. Lastly, pizza boxes are made with ethically sourced materials, which means that they don't harm the environment.

As pizza popularity soared after the World War II, pizzerias started to look for more sophisticated packaging. Unlike the paper bags used to store baked goods, cardboard offered light insulation, keeping the pies warm. In addition to corrugated cardboard, pizzerias began using paper bags with a corrugated base. This made them easier to handle and provided flat support.

The VENTiT Box, which allows steam and moisture to escape, is an excellent example of this innovation. The fluted channels in the corrugated medium allow steam and moisture to escape without harming the crust. This innovation required only a slight rearrangement of the traditional corrugated cardboard pizza box construction. Although there's no new technology required, the VENTiT Box uses a slightly different technique, which is still a patented innovation. In this method, the medium and inner liner are joined or cut, rather than sewn together, and the outer liner is folded over the top.

The problem with conventional corrugated cardboard pizza boxes is that they have two major flaws. First, the bottom panel 12 does not prevent grease from penetrating the box. This grease can cause the pizza to drip, staining the car seat and clothing. The flat, smooth surface of panel 12 also doesn't allow for good air circulation or heat retention. As a result, the bottom panel tends to become soggy, resulting in a soggy crust.
